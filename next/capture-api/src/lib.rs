//! # Netsim Capture API
//!
//! This crate defines the public API for the Netsim packet capture system.
//! It includes the core data structures, traits, and actions necessary for
//! interacting with the `capture-actor`.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! ### Structure
//!
//! The capture system is structured as follows:
//!
//! - **`netsim-model`**: Remains the base layer for data models (e.g.,
//!   `ChipId`, `ChipKind`). It does not depend on `capture-api`.
//! - **`capture-api`**: Defines the behavioral contract for the capture
//!   service.
//!     - Depends on: `netsim-model`
//!     - Contains: `CaptureAction` (enum of supported operations),
//!       `CaptureActionResult`, `CaptureSender` trait, and re-exports of
//!       relevant models.
//! - **`capture-actor`**: Implements the capture service.
//!     - Depends on: `capture-api`, `netsim-model`.
//!     - Implements the handling logic for `CaptureAction`.
//! - **`netsim-client`**: Provides a client-side wrapper for the capture
//!   service.
//!     - Depends on: `capture-api`, `netsim-model`.
//! - **Consumer Crates** (e.g., `device-actor`, `daemon`):
//!     - Depend on: `capture-api`, `netsim-client` (and `netsim-model` if
//!       needed).
//!     - Do not depend directly on `capture-actor` for API definitions.
//!
//! ### Dependency Graph (Simplified)
//!
//! ```text
//! graph TD
//!     ConsumerCrates[Consumer Crates<br>(device-actor, daemon)] --> NetsimClient[netsim-client]
//!     ConsumerCrates --> CaptureAPI[capture-api]
//!     NetsimClient --> CaptureAPI
//!     CaptureActor[capture-actor] --> CaptureAPI
//!     CaptureActor --> NetsimModel[netsim-model]
//!     CaptureAPI --> NetsimModel
//!     NetsimClient --> NetsimModel
//! ```
//!
//! ## API Definition
//!
//! The `capture-api` crate defines the following key components:
//!
//! ### `CaptureAction`
//!
//! An enum representing the actions that can be performed on the capture
//! service. This serves as the primary interface for consumers.
//!
//! ### `CaptureSender`
//!
//! A trait defining the interface for sending packets to the capture system.
//! This allows for dependency injection and easier testing.
//!
//! ## Benefits
//!
//! 1. **Clearer Boundaries**: The separation between API and implementation is
//!    now explicit.
//! 2. **Reduced Coupling**: Consumer crates only depend on the API, not the
//!    implementation.
//! 3. **Improved Build Times**: Changes to the `capture-actor` implementation
//!    do not require recompiling consumer crates, as long as the API remains
//!    stable.
//! 4. **Easier Testing**: Mocking the capture service is now a matter of
//!    implementing the `CaptureAction` contract or the `CaptureSender` trait.
