# Modem Simulator Roadmap

The Rust multi-device modem simulator is a replacement for the existing C++
[Unisoc library](#source-implementations).

The Unisoc simulator uses a process per emulated device. Testing multi-device
interactions like calls or SMS requires manual console commands or complex TCP
configuration to bridge these isolated processes.

In contrast, the new Rust implementation runs as a single service within Netsim
that manages multiple modem instances. This architecture enables sophisticated,
zero-configuration network-level interactions between simulated modem devices,
treating them as peers on a shared virtual telephony network.

## Scenarios

### Primary Scenarios

These scenarios are part of the initial release of the multi-device modem
simulator.

- **Device-to-Device (D2D) Call Signaling** [IMPLEMENTED]:
  - **Direct Dialing**: Emulator instances can dial each other using their
    simulated phone numbers.
  - **State Synchronization**: Ringing(`RING`), Answering(`ATA`), and
    Hangup(`ATH`) events are synchronized between the caller and callee.
- **Device-to-Device SMS** [IMPLEMENTED]:
  - **Direct Delivery**: SMS messages sent via `AT+CMGS` are instantly routed to
    the target instance and delivered as `+CMT` notifications.
- **Conference Calling** [PLANNED]: Support for multi-party voice calls
  involving more than two AVDs.
- **Simultaneous Services** [PLANNED]: Handling active voice calls concurrent
  with active data sessions.

### Secondary Scenarios

These scenarios represent advanced simulation capabilities that will be
implemented after the core required scenarios are stable.

- **Realistic Radio Layer & Network Simulation**:
  - **Signal Modeling**: Simulation of PHY/MAC layer aspects including signal
    strength, interference, path loss, and noise.
  - **Network Diversity**: Simulating characteristics of different network
    standards (GSM, LTE, 5G NR).
  - **Network Congestion**: Modeling resource contention and degraded
    performance with multiple active devices.
  - **Dynamic Environment**: API for real-time control of signal strength,
    registration status, and operator availability.

- **Data Plane & LAN Bridging**:
  - **LAN Gateway**: Forwarding data packets to the host network (simulating a
    gateway to the internet/LAN).
  - **Packet Routing**: Proper routing of IP packets between the simulated modem
    and the Netsim environment.

- **Mobility & Dynamic Conditions**:
  - **Handovers**: Simulating device movement and handovers between cells within
    a managed topology.
  - **Coverage Transitions**: Simulating devices entering/leaving coverage or
    transitioning into weak signal zones.

  - **Group Messaging**: Simulation of Group SMS and MMS exchanges across
    multiple devices.
  - **RCS Simulation**: Support for Rich Communication Services (chat, file
    transfer).
  - **Emergency Services**: Simulation of E911 calls with location reporting.
  - **Carrier-Specific Behaviors**: Modeling specific network restrictions,
    dynamic profile loading, and SIM lock states.
  - **OTA Updates**: Simulation of Over-the-Air updates to test diverse carrier
    scenarios.
  - **Complex Scenario Generation**: Scriptable test scenarios for multi-call
    flows, SMS/MMS failure injection, and data stall recovery.

- **Observability & Debugging**:
  - **State Reporting**: Structured query interface for real-time insight into
    internal modem state.
  - **Event Bus**: Pub/Sub mechanism for tracking internal state changes for
    validation.

- **Hardware Integration**:
  - **AT Command Proxy**: Bridging commands from Android guest to physical
    hardware modems for Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing.

commands. These commands allow users (and Android Studio) to inject events into
the modem.

  - [x] Implement logic to trigger an incoming call (`RING`, `+CLIP`) from an
        external event.

        to `SimState::Ready` w/ `NO CARRIER` etc).
- [x] **Data/Voice State (`gsm data`, `gsm voice`)**:
  - [x] Allow external control of `+CREG` and `+CGREG` states (Roaming,
        Searching, Denied, etc.).

## Cuttlefish Drop-in Compatibility

simulator used by Cuttlefish (and eventually Netsim). Focus on simplifying the
execution model to a single binary where possible, ensuring strictly compatible
CLI arguments and FD handling.

      legacy behavior.
- [ ] **Simplify Execution Model**: Evaluate removing the "Daemon/Proxy" split
      in favor of a monolithic run loop for Cuttlefish.
- [ ] **Integration Test**: Verify the binary runs correctly within a Cuttlefish
      instance.
