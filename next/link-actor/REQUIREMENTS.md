# Requirements: Link Actor

Link-Actor - Chip-to-Chip Link Management and Propagation Service

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

Link-Actor is a core microservice within `netsim` responsible for managing the
connectivity graph between emulated radio chips.

It serves as the source of truth for all links between chips, handling the
creation, modification, and deletion of these links. It synchronizes this state
across the system by processing lifecycle notifications from other actors and
propagating topology updates to relevant components.

### 1.2 Scope

The Link-Actor component handles:

- **Link Lifecycle**: Creation, Update, and Deletion of links.
- **Validation**: Ensuring links are only created between compatible chips
  (e.g., BLE to BLE).
- **State Propagation**: Pushing the current link state (peers and RSSI) to the
  relevant Chip Actors whenever a change occurs.
- **Chip Lifecycle Integration**: Automatically cleaning up links when a chip is
  removed.

The following are **out of scope**:

- **Packet Routing**: Link-Actor manages the _topology_, but the actual packet
  transmission is handled by the `PacketStream` or the Chip Actors themselves
  using the topology data provided by Link-Actor.
- **Physical Modeling**: Complex path loss models are computed externally;
  Link-Actor stores the resulting RSSI/Rx level.

### 1.3 Definitions and Acronyms

| Term     | Definition                                                                               |
| :------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Chip** | An emulated radio instance (e.g., Bluetooth Controller, Wi-Fi Interface).                |
| **Link** | A **directed** connection from a sender chip to a receiver chip with an associated RSSI. |
| **RSSI** | Received Signal Strength Indicator.                                                      |

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective

Link-Actor acts as the central topology manager in the `netsim-next`
architecture. It sits between the Frontend (Grpc, CLI, etc.) and the Chip
Actors.

It plays a critical role in the **Hybrid RSSI Determination** model:

1.  **Default (Distance-based)**: By default, RSSI is calculated based on the
    distance between devices (managed largely by the physical model/scene).
2.  **Explicit (Link-based)**: If a link exists in the `Link-Actor`, its
    configured RSSI **overrides** the default distance-based value.

This allows users to force specific connection states (e.g., perfect signal or
total disconnection) regardless of physical proximity.

### 2.2 User Characteristics

- **Test Engineers**: Use `netsim` CLI or scripts (Python/Mobly) to define
  network topology, control attenuation, and simulate mobility scenarios (e.g.,
  driving out of range).
- **Platform Developers**: Developers working on connectivity stacks (Bluetooth,
  UWB, Wi-Fi) who need to verify behavior under specific link conditions (RSSI
  changes, packet loss).
- **App Developers**: Indirect users who expect that emulated devices can
  discover and connect to each other in a realistic manner. They may also want
  to trigger multi-device events based on proximity or RSSI (e.g., Nearby Share,
  Digital Key).

### 2.3 User Needs

- **UN-001**: **Consistency**: Users need to know that if they set an RSSI, it
  is immediately reflected in the physical model.
- **UN-002**: **Safety**: Users should be prevented from creating invalid links
  (e.g., Bluetooth connected to Wi-Fi).

### 2.4 Constraints

- Must be non-blocking and asynchronous.
- Must handle dynamic arrival and departure of chips.

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies

- Device Actor registers chip existence with Link-Actor via `NotifyChipAdded`.
- **Radio Actors** (Bluetooth, WiFi, UWB) must implement the generic
  [`ChipClient`](../model/src/chip.rs) interface to receive topology and RSSI
  updates from Link-Actor. Link-Actor is agnostic to the specific radio
  protocol.

## 3. Standards and References

- **[`netsim-model`](../model)**: Internal crate defining core types (`Link`,
  `Chip`, `ChipKind`).
- **[`netsim-proto`](../proto)**: gRPC/Protobuf definitions for the external
  API.
- **[`link-api`](../link-api)**: Internal crate defining the
  [`LinkClient`](../link-api/src/lib.rs) trait.

## 4. Functional Requirements

> [!IMPORTANT] All functional requirements listed below are mandatory (Priority
> P0).

### 4.1 Link Management

- **RQ-LINK-01**: The system shall allow creating a link between two valid,
  existing chips.
- **RQ-LINK-02**: The system shall prevent creating a link between chips of
  different kinds (e.g., mismatching `ChipKind`).
- **RQ-LINK-03**: The system shall prevent creating a self-loop (link to self).
- **RQ-LINK-04**: The system shall prevent creating a duplicate link if one
  already exists between the same pair.
- **RQ-LINK-05**: The system shall allow updating the RSSI of an existing link.
- **RQ-LINK-06**: The system shall allow deleting an existing link.
- **RQ-LINK-07**: The system shall treat links as **directed** (asymmetric). An
  RSSI update to A->B shall **not** affect B->A.

### 4.2 State Propagation ("The Push Model")

- **RQ-PROP-01**: Upon any change to a link (create, update, delete), the system
  shall push the **complete list of active peers** to the affected **sender
  chip** only.
  > **Note**: This "Full State Push" strategy ensures the chip always has an
  > authoritative view of its neighbors, avoiding state drift. It does **not**
  > update unaffected chips.
- **RQ-PROP-02**: The pushed update shall include the `ChipId` and `RSSI` for
  all current neighbors of the sender.

### 4.3 Lifecycle Management

- **RQ-LIFE-01**: The system shall track the existence of chips via
  `NotifyChipAdded` and `NotifyChipRemoved` events.
- **RQ-LIFE-02**: When a chip is removed, the system shall automatically delete
  all links where that chip is a sender or receiver.
- **RQ-LIFE-03**: When links are auto-deleted due to chip removal, the system
  shall propagate the updated state to the remaining **senders** (e.g., if A->B
  is removed because B died, A must be notified).

### 4.4 Observability and Stats

- **RQ-OBS-01**: The system shall track the total number of links created during
  the session.
- **RQ-OBS-02**: The system shall track the total number of RSSI updates
  (patches) performed.
- **RQ-OBS-03**: The system shall track the current number of active links.
- **RQ-OBS-04**: The system shall expose these statistics via a queryable
  interface for monitoring and debugging.

### 4.5 Querying

- **RQ-QUERY-01**: The system shall provide a `list` capability to retrieve all
  active links.

### 4.6 Frontend Integration

- **RQ-FRONT-01**: The system shall expose link listing capabilities via the
  gRPC Frontend API (`ListLink`).
- **RQ-FRONT-02**: The system shall expose link patching capabilities via the
  gRPC Frontend API (`PatchLink`).
- **RQ-FRONT-03**: The system shall expose link deletion capabilities via the
  gRPC Frontend API (`DeleteLink`).

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

- **RQ-NFR-01**: **Atomicity**: Link updates must be atomic. A chip should never
  see a partial state.
- **RQ-NFR-02**: **Performance**: Link updates should be propagated to chip
  actors with minimal latency (sub-millisecond internal processing) to support
  real-time emulations.

## 6. Verification

Verification is performed via BDD-style Integration Tests in `tests/`.
