# Netsim TAP Networking

This document describes how to use and verify the TAP (Network Tap) networking feature in `netsim-next`.

The TAP feature allows the emulated Android device (Goldfish) to have a direct layer 2 presence on the host network, instead of using the default user-space SLiRP stack.

## How it Works

When enabled, the Netsim daemon (`netsimd`) manages a TAP interface (or a pool of interfaces) on the host.
- Packets from the emulator's Wi-Fi interface are sent to `netsimd` via gRPC.
- `netsimd` writes these packets to the host TAP interface.
- Packets received on the host TAP interface are sent back to the emulator via gRPC.

This enables features like DHCP, IPv6, and direct connectivity between the emulator and other devices on the host network.

## Prerequisites

To use the TAP feature, you need to have TAP interfaces set up on your host and a DHCP server running to assign IP addresses to the emulators.

### Option 1: Using Cuttlefish TAP Pool (Recommended for Google Devs)

If you are developing on a gLinux machine (desktop or Cloudtop), you can use the pre-configured Cuttlefish TAP pool.

#### One-time Setup (if not yet installed)

To install and configure the Cuttlefish TAP pool on your host machine, please follow the canonical guide at **[go/cuttlefish-glinux](http://go/cuttlefish-glinux)** to install `cuttlefish-common`, add your user to the required groups, and reboot your host machine.

#### Verification and Activation

Once installed, verify that the TAP interfaces are active.

**Verify TAP devices are available:**
You can check if the Cuttlefish TAP interfaces are created by running:
```bash
ip link show | grep cvd-etap
```
*Expected Output:* You should see a list of interfaces like `cvd-etap-01` through `cvd-etap-10`.

*(Note: If the interfaces are not visible or are DOWN, ensure you have completed the setup in [go/cuttlefish-glinux](http://go/cuttlefish-glinux) and rebooted your host machine.)*

`netsimd` will automatically use the sub-range `cvd-etap-06` to `cvd-etap-10` to avoid conflicts with active Cuttlefish instances.

### Option 2: Manual Setup (Custom TAP)

If you don't have Cuttlefish installed, you can set up a manual TAP interface.

1.  **Create the TAP interface (e.g., `tap0`) owned by your user:**
    ```bash
    sudo ip tuntap add mode tap user $USER tap0
    sudo ip link set tap0 up
    sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.1/24 dev tap0
    ```

2.  **Start a DHCP server (e.g., `dnsmasq`):**
    The emulator needs to acquire an IP address. Start `dnsmasq` on `tap0` (runs in the foreground, run this in a separate terminal window):
    ```bash
    sudo dnsmasq --interface=tap0 --bind-interfaces --dhcp-range=192.168.1.10,192.168.1.50,12h --no-daemon --port=0
    ```

3.  **Enable IP Forwarding & NAT (for Internet Access):**
    Enable forwarding on the host:
    ```bash
    sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
    ```
    Then configure IP masquerading (NAT) to allow the emulator to access the internet (replace `eth0` with your active host internet interface, e.g., `wlan0` or `enp0s31f6`):
    ```bash
    sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.1.0/24 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
    ```

## How to Run

To run the emulator with the TAP gateway, you must ensure you are using a compatible emulator version.

### 1. Emulator Version Requirement
Ensure you are using Android Emulator version **`37.1.1.0`** or newer. You can check your version by running `emulator -version`.

### 2. Start the Emulator

*   **For Option 1 (Cuttlefish pool - Recommended)**:
    ```bash
    emulator @Pixel_6 -netsim-args "--wifi-cvd-tap"
    ```
*   **For Option 2 (Custom TAP)**:
    ```bash
    emulator @Pixel_6 -netsim-args "--wifi-tap tap0"
    ```

## How to Verify It Works

To confirm that the emulator is actually using the TAP interface and routing traffic through your host network (instead of falling back to the default SLiRP stack):

### 1. Check the IP Address on the AVD (Guest)
The default SLiRP stack assigns a `10.0.x.x` IP. If TAP is working, **the emulator's Wi-Fi interface must have an IP that matches the range configured in your DHCP server.**

Run the following command:
```bash
adb shell ip addr show wlan0
```
**Expected Output:**
You should see a line showing a global IP address matching your network:
*   **For Option 1 (Cuttlefish Pool)**: Typically in the **`192.168.98.x`** or **`192.168.96.x`** range.
    ```
    inet 192.168.98.10/24 brd 192.168.98.255 scope global wlan0
    ```
*   **For Option 2 (Custom TAP `tap0`)**: Matches the range you configured in `dnsmasq` (e.g., **`192.168.1.x`**).
    ```
    inet 192.168.1.21/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global wlan0
    ```

### 2. Check the `netsimd` Logs (Host)
Verify that `netsimd` successfully bound to the TAP interface by inspecting its stdout log (grep for both `tap0` and Cuttlefish's `cvd-etap`). Note that the log directory remains `netsimd`:
```bash
cat /tmp/android-$USER/netsimd/netsim_stdout.log | grep -E "tap0|cvd-etap"
```
**Expected Output:**
You should see logs indicating `netsimd` opened and attached the TAP interface:
*   **For Option 1 (Cuttlefish)**:
    ```
    netsim I ... tap_gateway.rs:114 - Opened TAP interface: cvd-etap-06
    netsim I ... tap_gateway.rs:446 - Attached TAP cvd-etap-06 to chip 0
    ```
*   **For Option 2 (Custom TAP)**:
    ```
    netsim I ... tap_gateway.rs:114 - Opened TAP interface: tap0
    netsim I ... tap_gateway.rs:446 - Attached TAP tap0 to chip 0
    ```
If you do not see these lines, double check that your host setup (Cuttlefish resources or custom `dnsmasq`/`tap0`) is running and active.
